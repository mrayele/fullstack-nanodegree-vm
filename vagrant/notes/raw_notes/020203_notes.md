### Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

##### Video Notes
- Primary Keys
  - Every row in a table should have a column or set of columns that is a unique identifier for the entire row
  - <u>Primary Key</u>: 1 or more columns that uniquely identify the entire row
  - <u>Composite Key</u>: Set of primary key columns (when the primary key is made of more than one column)
- Foreign Keys
  - a **foreign key** maps two primary keys, encoding a relationship from one table to another. It must be the primary key of another table. 

##### Takeaways

**Primary Keys**
- The primary key is the unique identifier for the entire row, referring to 1 or *more* columns.
- If there are more than 1 columns for the primary key, then the set of primary key columns is known as a **composite key**.

**Foreign Keys**
- Maps the primary key from another (foreign) table, within a given table.
- Encodes relationships from one table to another.
