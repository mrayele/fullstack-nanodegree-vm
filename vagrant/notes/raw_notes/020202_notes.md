### Relational Databases

##### Instructor Notes
Over the next couple of pages, we'll briefly go over some of the fundamental concepts concerning *relational databases*. In general, we're assuming that you've had some experience with relational databases, and that these ideas are not entirely new to you.

That said, if this *is* new to you, or if you feel shaky on this topic, don't worryâ€”we'll provide some additional resources that you can use to learn (or review) the basics that you'll need for this course.

##### Video Notes
- Recap of Fundamental Concepts
  - What is a Database?
    - a **database** is a collection of data
    - a **database system** is a system for storing collections of data in some organized way
  - Properties of Databases
    - **Persistence** (allowing access later, after it was created)
    - **Shared source of truth** accessible by many users
    - **Ability to store many types of data** (efficiently)
    - **Concurrency control** (handling multiple db actions at once)
  - Split between **relational** and **nonrelational** database management systems
    - **relational** DMS
      - Popular Relational Database Vendors for the Web: Postgre SQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite
      - All **relational** database systems tend to operate similarly
    - **nonrelational** ("noSQL") DMS
      - Popular noSQL Databases include: mongoDB (document stores), Persist (Object Databases), cassandra (Column stores), neo4j graph databases
    - Most web applications use more reliable/older relational DMS
    - noSQL databases are preferred only in special-use cases for niche applications
    - noSQL databases are often compared to relational databases to discover the strengths of non-relational databases over relational databases
  - Foundations of Relational Databases
    - All data is stored in *tables*
    - Every table is characterized by a list of *columns* with *data types* per column and its set of **data** (organized in **rows**)
    - Comes with rules for enforcing <u>data integrity</u> such as **constraints** and **triggers**
      - <u>data integrity</u>: concerns the accuracy and consistency of data stored in databases

If you'd like to spend some time going over the basic concepts of relational databases, you can check out Udacity's free course [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197).

I also recommend this video, [An Introduction to Relational Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kbsG8zsLM), which introduces the thinking behind relational databases, how they resolve issues of inconsistent data entry, and how they allow different pieces of data to relate to one another using primary keys (we'll talk more about primary keys in a moment).
