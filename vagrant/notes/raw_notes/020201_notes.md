### Lesson Overview

##### Instructor Notes
Here are the three core topics we'll be covering in this lesson:

#### 1. Interacting with a (remote) database
Backend developers need to interact with databases on a regular basis in order to manipulate and maintain the models behind their web applications. In this lesson, we'll build a foundational understanding of how those interactions work.

This foundational understanding will be essential in later lessons when we get into more advanced concepts related to database interactions.

In working with a database, we'll need to use a **Database Management System (DBMS)**. There are many different systems out there, but the particular DBMS we'll be using is called [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or simply Postgres).

#### 2. Database Application Programming Interfaces (DBAPIs)
Once we've looked at the basics of interacting with a database, we'll need to understand how to interface with that database from another language or web server framework (such as Python, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, etc.). This is where **DBAPIs** come in.

In this lesson, we'll go over the basics of **DBAPIs**, and how they are used to interact with a database from another language (like Python).

#### 3. psycopg2
Then finally, we'll get some experience working specifically with the widely used [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) library, which will allow us to interact with a database from Python.
